# Crack Propagation in Brittle Materials
## 2024

From little or nothing, to experimental verification of a complex fracture experiment.

### Running the notebooks (to be tested *prior* to course start)

To run a Docker container on a local machine.

1. Install Docker following the instructions at
   https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.

2. Clone this repository using git:

       git clone https://github.com/kumiori/mec647.git

3. Run `./launcher.sh`.

Although we recommend using Docker locally, you can also use the cloud-based Google Colab service to execute the notebooks.

### Prerequisites

The course will assume basic knowledge of the theory of infinitesimal elasticity and
finite element methods.

Basic knowledge of Python will be assumed, see https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython
to brush up if you feel unsure.

Basic knowledge of git as a versioning system with feature-branch workflow

Remember to set your name and email before pushing to the repository,
either locally or globally, see https://www.phpspiderblog.com/how-to-configure-username-and-email-in-git/
