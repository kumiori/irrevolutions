The models folder contains __init__.py , a python script defining new classes for modeling elasticity and damage in materials.
Overall, the script provides a flexible framework for modeling various material behaviors related to elasticity, damage, and variable thickness, particularly suited for applications in mechanics and materials science., and with specific applications such as brittle membranes over an elastic foundation.


ElasticityModel 
From the mechanical point of view, the focus is on linearized kinematics for which materials are fully characterized by a set of material parameters, Young's modulus (E), Poisson ratio (nu), and Lame coefficients (lambda, mu). We define methods for calculating strain (eps), elastic energy density from strain (elastic_energy_density_strain), and total energy density (total_energy_density).

DamageElasticityModel Class: 
Extends to include damage modeling. It introduces additional parameters related to damage such as w1, ell, and k_res. It provides methods for calculating damage-related energy density (damage_energy_density) and total energy density.

BrittleMembraneOverElasticFoundation Class: 
Extends DamageElasticityModel to model a brittle membrane over an elastic foundation. It introduces additional parameters such as ell_e and eps_0, and defines methods for calculating elastic foundation density (elastic_foundation_density) and stress.

VariableThickness Class (Decorator): 
Defines a decorator class VariableThickness that accepts a model class as an argument. It modifies the model's behavior to account for variable thickness, adjusting energy densities based on the thickness provided.

BanquiseVaryingThickness Class (Decorator):
Uses VariableThickness decorator to create a class BanquiseVaryingThickness, which represents a varying thickness of a brittle membrane over an elastic foundation.
