	abstract = {This paper studies the initiation of cracks in the thermal shock problem through the variational analysis of the quasi-static evolution of a gradient damage model. We consider a two-dimensional semi-infinite slab with an imposed temperature drop on its free surface. The damage model is formulated in the framework of the variational theory of rate-independent processes based on the principles of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. In the case of a sufficiently severe shock, we show that damage immediately occurs and that its evolution follows first a fundamental branch without localization. Then it bifurcates into another branch in which damage localization will take place finally to generate cracks. The determination of the time and mode of that bifurcation allows us to explain the periodic distribution of the so-initiated cracks and to calculate the crack spacing in terms of the material and loading parameters. Numerical investigations complete and quantify the analytical results.},

	abstract = {Second-order rate constitutive equations are formulated for a time-independent elastic-plastic material, obeying the normality flow rule with a smooth yield surface. Under specified regularity restrictions imposed on the involved fields, the regular second-order rate boundary value problem with quasistatic accelerations as unknowns is posed. It is shown that every solution of this generally non-linear rate problem is governed by a variational principle and that the corresponding functional reaches a strict absolute minimum, provided the solution satisfies a sufficient uniqueness condition. With the same incrementally linear comparison solid, Hill's exclusion condition rules out not only a first- but also a second-order bifurcation. The criticality of the exclusion condition is discussed and conditions are indicated under which a second-order bifurcation becomes possible, while the first-order rate problem is still uniquely solvable.},

@article{MIEHE20102765,
	abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F. Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase field models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-field fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering DOI:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-field-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history field. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase field. The introduction of the history field provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively updates in a typical time step the history field, the crack phase field and finally the displacement field. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples.},

@article{Miehe10,
	abstract = {Abstract The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase-field. In this paper, we outline a thermodynamically consistent framework for phase-field models of crack propagation in elastic solids, develop incremental variational principles and consider their numerical implementations by multi-field finite element methods. We start our investigation with an intuitive and descriptive derivation of a regularized crack surface functional that Γ-converges for vanishing length-scale parameter to a sharp crack topology functional. This functional provides the basis for the definition of suitable convex dissipation functions that govern the evolution of the crack phase-field. Here, we propose alternative rate-independent and viscous over-force models that ensure the local growth of the phase-field. Next, we define an energy storage function whose positive tensile part degrades with increasing phase-field. With these constitutive functionals at hand, we derive the coupled balances of quasi-static stress equilibrium and gradient-type phase-field evolution in the solid from the argument of virtual power. Here, we consider a canonical two-field setting for rate-independent response and a time-regularized three-field formulation with viscous over-force response. It is then shown that these balances follow as the Euler equations of incremental variational principles that govern the multi-field problems. These principles make the proposed formulation extremely compact and provide a perfect base for the finite element implementation, including features such as the symmetry of the monolithic tangent matrices. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed phase-field formulations of fracture by means of representative numerical examples. Copyright {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Therefore, most of the methods offered by the library are projection methods such as Arnoldi or Lanczos, or other methods with similar properties. SLEPc provides basic methods as well as more sophisticated algorithms. It also provides built-in support for spectral transformations such as the shift-and-invert technique. SLEPc is a general library in the sense that it covers standard and generalized eigenvalue problems, both Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic.SLEPc can be easily applied to real world problems. To illustrate this, several case studies arising from real applications are presented and solved with SLEPc with little programming effort. The addressed problems include a matrix-free standard problem, a complex generalized problem, and a singular value decomposition. The implemented codes exhibit good properties regarding flexibility as well as parallel performance.},

	abstract = {Gradient damage models used in phase-field approaches to brittle fracture are characterised by material softening and instabilities. We present novel numerical techniques for the bifurcation and stability analysis along quasi-static evolution paths as well as practical tools to select stable evolutions. Our approach stems from the variational approach to fracture and the theory of rate-independent irreversible processes whereby a quasi-static evolution is formulated in terms of incremental energy minimisation under unilateral constraints. Focusing on the discrete setting obtained with finite elements techniques, we discuss the links between bifurcation criteria for an evolution and stability of equilibrium states. Key concepts are presented through the analytical solution of a two-degrees-of-freedom model featuring a continuum family of bifurcation branches. We introduce numerical methods to (i) assess (second-order) stability conditions for time-discrete evolutions subject to damage irreversibility, and (ii) to select possible stable evolutions based on an energetic criterion. Our approach is based on the solution of a coupled eigenvalue problem which accounts for the time-discrete irreversibility constraint on damage. Several numerical examples illustrate that this approach allows us to filter out unstable solutions provided by standard (first-order) minimisation algorithms as well as to effectively compute stable evolution paths. We demonstrate our purpose on a multifissuration problem featuring complex fracture patterns, to show how the eigenvalue analysis enables to compute and retrieve morphological properties of emerging cracks.},

@article{leon-baldelli:2021-numerical,
	abstract = {Gradient damage models used in phase-field approaches to brittle fracture are characterised by material softening and instabilities. We present novel numerical techniques for the bifurcation and stability analysis along quasi-static evolution paths as well as practical tools to select stable evolutions. Our approach stems from the variational approach to fracture and the theory of rate-independent irreversible processes whereby a quasi-static evolution is formulated in terms of incremental energy minimisation under unilateral constraints. Focusing on the discrete setting obtained with finite elements techniques, we discuss the links between bifurcation criteria for an evolution and stability of equilibrium states. Key concepts are presented through the analytical solution of a two-degrees-of-freedom model featuring a continuum family of bifurcation branches. We introduce numerical methods to (i) assess (second-order) stability conditions for time-discrete evolutions subject to damage irreversibility, and (ii) to select possible stable evolutions based on an energetic criterion. Our approach is based on the solution of a coupled eigenvalue problem which accounts for the time-discrete irreversibility constraint on damage. Several numerical examples illustrate that this approach allows us to filter out unstable solutions provided by standard (first-order) minimisation algorithms as well as to effectively compute stable evolution paths. We demonstrate our purpose on a multifissuration problem featuring complex fracture patterns, to show how the eigenvalue analysis enables to compute and retrieve morphological properties of emerging cracks.},

This work deals with the analysis of cone-constrained eigenvalue problems. We discuss some theoretical issues like, for instance, the estimation of the maximal number of eigenvalues in a cone-constrained problem. Special attention is paid to the Paretian case. As a short addition to the theoretical part, we introduce and study two algorithms for solving numerically such type of eigenvalue problems.},
