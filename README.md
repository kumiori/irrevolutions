`Irrevolutions` is a computational stability analysis toolkit designed to solve nonlinear and nonconvex evolutionary problems using advanced numerical methods. It provides efficient algorithms for computing solutions for constrained minimum problems with application to irreversible evolutions (hence its name). In particular, this framework is relevant in the context of fracture and damage mechanics.

**Irreversible Evolution of Damage**

Let $y=(\alpha, u)$ be an admissible state of a brittle system where $\alpha: \Omega \mapsto [0, 1]$ is a smooth damage field which identifies cracks (where $\alpha =1$) and $u$ is a displacement field. Provided a material model (an energy functional) $E_\ell$, given a time horizon $T$, let's find a map $t \in [0, T]\mapsto y_t$ such that: damage is non-decreasing and the observed state $y_t$ is energy-minimal, among admissible variations.

### Installation

Before installing `irrevolutions`, ensure you have `dolfinx` and other dependencies installed.

DOLFINx (and some other libraries like MPI and PyVista) have complex dependencies, it may be best to install them using conda from the conda-forge channel. Conda handles the environment setup and dependency conflicts well for these low-level libraries. Otherwise, you install from source using Spack or us a pre-built docker image.

Then, install your Python package dependencies with Poetry. After installing system-level dependencies with Conda (or another method), you can use Poetry to manage the Python-specific packages and virtual environment for your project. Poetry will not attempt to reinstall DOLFINx or other system-level packages.

More specifically, you can install `dolfinx` using one of the following methods:

- Using conda

```bash
conda create -n fenicsx-env -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx=0.7.2 mpich pyvista sympy pandas pyyaml
conda activate fenicsx-env
```

- Using Spack
  see https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/blob/main/README.md#spack

- Using Apt (ubuntu 23.04 build)

```bash
apt-get install -y  software-properties-common python3-pip git libgl1-mesa-glx xvfb libglu1 libxcursor1 libxinerama1

add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics
apt update
apt-install fenicsx
```

For detailed instructions, see https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/blob/main/README.md#installation

- Using a Docker container

For an ARM-based machine:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v "$(pwd)":/home/numerix -w /home/numerix kumiori3/numerix:stable
```

For an AMD64 machine:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v "$(pwd)":/home/numerix -w /home/numerix kumiori3/numerix:stable-amd64
```

For a windows box:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v "C:/...":/home/numerix" -w /home/numerix kumiori3\numerix:stable-amd64
```

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumiori/irrevolutions.gt
cd irrevolutions
```

Finally, `irrevolutions` can be installed using setuptools from the root directory

```bash
python3 -m pip install .
```
